# randomvaudeville
Random Vaudeville was developed by me as a thank you gift for a friend. She offered me a place to stay during a week-long conference, and a mobile app/website of random vaudeville routines seemed to be a fun show of gratitude. It has been a practice coding site ever since.

To use: simply press Vaudeville Me! and enjoy the random vaudeville routine that appears. Acting them out with friends is highly recommended.
